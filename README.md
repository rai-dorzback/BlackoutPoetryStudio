# FoundPoetry

FoundPoetry (tentatively named) is a web app that enables users to create blackout poetry by merging and manipulating text from various sources.

## Features

- **Random Poem:** Generate a random poem for creative inspiration.
- **Search Functionality:** Find specific poems using search queries. Including the ability to choose the line count of the poem
- **Set Custom Text:** Add text of your own to base your found poem off of.
- **Blackout Poetry Editor:** Craft your blackout poetry with an intuitive text editor.
- **Save and Share:** Save your creations and share them on social media.
- **Text Merging:** Combine lines or stanzas from different poems to create unique compositions.

## Development Stage
- I am currently in the first phase of development and have begun basic styling (it is not responsive yet). 
- Current functionality includes: the ability to generate a random poem, the ability to select which words you want to be in your poem, and the ability to reset the poem so no words are selected anymore.

## Next Steps to Implement
- Blackout functionality
- Save progress in local storage so it doesn't delete user progress if they refresh it
- Search functionality to get poem by searching the database by keyword, author, etc.
- Ability to work with custom text
- Ability to save and share your poem
