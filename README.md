FoundPoetry (tentatively named) is a web app that enables users to create blackout poetry by merging and manipulating text from various sources.

## Features

- **Random Poem:** Generate a random poem for creative inspiration.
- **Search Functionality:** Find specific poems using search queries. Including the ability to choose the line count of the poem
- **Set Custom Text:** Add text of your own to base your found poem off of.
- **Blackout Poetry Editor:** Craft your blackout poetry with an intuitive text editor.
- **Save and Share:** Save your creations and share them on social media.
- **Text Merging:** Combine lines or stanzas from different poems to create unique compositions.

## Development Stage
- I am currently in the first phase of development and have begun basic styling (it is not responsive yet). At the moment, the functionality includes the ability to generate a random poem.
