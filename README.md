# FoundPoetry

FoundPoetry (tentatively named) is a web app that enables users to create blackout poetry by merging and manipulating text from various sources.

## Features

- **Random Poem:** Generate a random poem for creative inspiration.
- **Search Functionality:** Find specific poems using search queries. Including the ability to choose the line count of the poem
- **Set Custom Text:** Add text of your own to base your found poem off of.
- **Blackout Poetry Editor:** Craft your blackout poetry with an intuitive text editor.
- **Save and Share:** Save your creations and share them on social media.
- **Text Merging:** Combine lines or stanzas from different poems to create unique compositions.

## Development Stage
- I am currently in the first phase of development and have begun basic styling (it is not responsive yet). 
- Current functionality includes the ability to: 
  - generate a random poem
  - select which words you want to be in your poem
  - reset the poem so no words are selected anymore

## Next Steps/Features to Implement
1. Blackout functionality
2. Save progress in local storage so it doesn't delete user progress if they refresh it
3. Search functionality to get poem by searching the database by keyword, author, etc.
4. Create a blackout poem using custom text
5. Save and share your poem
6. Add instructions for user. (Possibly something collapsible where they can choose to show or hide the instructions.)
